I. Adding the openhab layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the openhab layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the openhab layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-openhab \
    "


II. Misc
========

Both runtime and addon files are installed, but the addons you prefer
to use must be copied manually from /usr/openhab-addons to 
/usr/openhab/addons
